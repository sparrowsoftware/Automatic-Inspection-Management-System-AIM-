Advantages of the system<br>
Multi-protocol, multi-product support<br><br>
Supports multiple main protocols such as SSH (SFTP), TELNET, FTP, POP3, HTTP (S).<br>
Access to servers, switches, routers, storage devices and many other hardware products and application servers, databases, <br>middleware, custom software and other software products.<br>
Through simulating the manual inspection method, realizes the application level, the fine granularity full scale monitoring.
<br>Achieve more efficient and secure monitoring of Windows devices through self-developed WindowsAgent.<br>
User fully autonomous and controllable<br><br>
There is no need to install any agents on the target device (except for Windows hosts), with open, flexible, loosely coupled <br>features.<br>
Users can increase the monitoring target equipment and monitoring tasks according to the need, and avoid the dependence on the <br>software vendors.<br>
Easy to use, efficient handling of problems<br><br>
Provide a variety of flexible and easy-to-use verification methods with the intuitive way of "WYSIWYG".<br>
Provide the user with the processing methods of this question in past, and greatly improve the efficiency of problem handling.<br>
Easy for new recruits to learn how to deal with all kinds of system problems, the new start time is greatly shortened.<br>
Support for bulk deployments to manage clusters more efficiently.<br>
Rigid execution of inspection regulations<br><br>
In view of every problem found in inspection, technicians must fill in the processing measures so that they can generate inspection <br>reports. Thus form a closed loop of management, and ensure the rigid execution of inspection regulations.<br>
Simple to deploy, robust to run<br><br>
Only one normal Windows computer, one-click installation, 5 minutes to install complete.<br>
Perfect system fault-tolerant processing mechanism, resource occupancy is very small, running robust.<br>
Automatic inspection, safe and reliable<br><br>
Encrypted storage of sensitive data to ensure data security<br>
